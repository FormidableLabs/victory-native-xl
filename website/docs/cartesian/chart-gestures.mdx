# Chart Gestures

The `CartesianChart` component has opt-in support for "press" gestures, including multi-press support. At this point in time, the "press" gesture support is limited to tracking the user's fingers' x-coordinate on the chart and exposing the _closest_ (in terms of x-coordinate) point to the user's gesture.

The goal for this press support is to allow the user to press/pan across the chart and track what x-value they're pressing/panning over.

<div className="flex justify-center mb-10">
  <div className="rounded-md overflow-hidden border shadow">
    <ReactPlayer
      width={350}
      height={(1096 / 764) * 350}
      playing={true}
      loop={true}
      controls={true}
      url={stocksMp4}
    />
  </div>
</div>

For an introductory example, see [the Adding a tooltip section](../getting-started.mdx#adding-a-tooltip) of the Getting Started guide.

This "press gesture" support is outlined below.

## `useChartPressState`

At a high level, `useChartPressState` takes an initial state object and returns a `ChartPressState` value, which is effectively a wrapper around a group of Reanimated `SharedValue`s used to track the user's press gesture (and the corresponding x/y values and positions).

The signature for this function is:

```ts
useChartPressState<Init extends ChartPressStateInit>(init: Init): { isActive: boolean; state: ChartPressState<Init> }

type ChartPressStateInit = { x: InputFieldType; y: Record<string, number> };
export type ChartPressState<Init extends ChartPressStateInit> = {
  isActive: SharedValue<boolean>;
  x: { value: SharedValue<Init["x"]>; position: SharedValue<number> };
  y: Record<
    keyof Init["y"],
    { value: SharedValue<number>; position: SharedValue<number> }
  >;
};
```

You'll pass the `useChartPressState().state` value into the `chartPressState` prop of the `CartesianChart` component, and can use that `state` field to track e.g. active x-value or x-position of the users touch state. You can use the `useChartPressState().isActive` field to dynamically show elements with the user is actively pressing the chart.

## The `chartPressState` prop of `CartesianChart`

As outlined in [the Cartesian Chart page](./cartesian-chart.md#chartpressstate), the `chartPressState` prop of the `CartesianChart` component will accept a `ChartPressState` value returned from the `useChartPressState` hook and use that to track the users gesture state.

## Multi-press support

The `CartesianChart` component can track as many fingers as you want, but two will likely be the max you'd reasonably want to use. See [the multi-press guide](./guides/multi-press.md) to see an example of multi-press in action.

To support multi-press gestures, you merely generate multiple `ChartPressState` values using the `useChartPressState` hook and pass those state values into the `chartPressState` prop as an array. For example:

```tsx
import { useChartPressState, CartesianChart } from "victory-native";

const INIT_STATE = { x: 0, y: { highTmp: 0 } } as const;

function MyChart() {
  // ðŸ‘‡ create multiple press states
  const { state: firstPress, isActive: isFirstPressActive } =
    useChartPressState(INIT_STATE);
  const { state: secondPress, isActive: isSecondPressActive } =
    useChartPressState(INIT_STATE);


  return (
    <CartesianChart
      // ...
      yKeys={["highTmp"]}
      // ðŸ‘‡ pass them both into chartPressState to be tracked
      chartPressState={[firstPress, secondPress]}
    >
      {() => (
        // ...
      )}
    </CartesianChart>
  )
}
```
