# `Line` (Component)

The `Line` component takes a `PointsArray` prop, as well as some options for styling/animating, and returns a Skia `Path` element to draw the line chart.

## Example

```tsx
import { CartesianChart, Line } from "victory-native";
import DATA from "./my-data";

export function MyChart() {
  return (
    <CartesianChart data={DATA} xKey="x" yKeys={["y"]}>
      {({ points }) => (
        //ðŸ‘‡ pass a PointsArray to the Line component, as well as options.
        <Line
          points={points.y}
          color="red"
          strokeWidth={3}
          animate={{ type: "timing", duration: 300 }}
        />
      )}
    </CartesianChart>
  );
}
```

## Props

### `points`

A `PointsArray` array that comes from a field of the `points` object exposed the `children` render function of `CartesianChart`, as illustrated in the example above.

### `animate`

The `animate` prop takes [a `PathAnimationConfig` object](../../animated-paths.md#animconfig) and will animate the path when the points changes.

### `curveType`

[A `CurveType` value](./use-line-path.md#options) that indicates the type of curve should be drawn (e.g. `linear` or `natural`).

### `children`

A `children` pass-thru that will be rendered inside of the Skia `Path` element, useful if you'd like to make e.g. a gradient path.

### Paint properties

The `Line` component will also pass the following [painting props](https://shopify.github.io/react-native-skia/docs/paint/overview) down to the underlying `Path` component:

- `color`
- `strokeWidth`
- `strokeJoin`
- `strokeCap`
- `blendMode`
- `strokeMiter`
- `opacity`
- `antiAlias`
