# `Bar` (Component)

The `Bar` component takes a `PointsArray` prop, a `ChartBounds` object, as well as some options for styling/animating, and returns a Skia `Path` element to draw the line chart.

## Example

```tsx
import { CartesianChart, Bar } from "victory-native";
import DATA from "./my-data";

export function MyChart() {
  return (
    <CartesianChart data={DATA} xKey="x" yKeys={["y"]}>
      {({ points, chartBounds }) => (
        //ðŸ‘‡ pass a PointsArray to the Bar component, as well as options.
        <Bar points={points.y} chartBounds={chartBounds} color="red" />
      )}
    </CartesianChart>
  );
}
```

## Props

### `points`

A `PointsArray` array that comes from a field of the `points` object exposed the `children` render function of `CartesianChart`, as illustrated in the example above.

### `chartBounds`

A `ChartBounds` object needed to appropriately draw the bars. This generally comes from the `chartBounds` render argument of `CartesianChart`.

### `innerPadding`

An optional `number` between 0 and 1 that represents what fraction of the horizontal space between the first and last bars should be "white space". Defaults to `0.2`. Use `0` for no gap between bars, and values closer to `1` to make bars increasingly narrow.

### `animate`

The `animate` prop takes [a `PathAnimationConfig` object](../animated-paths.md#animconfig) and will animate the path when the points changes.

### `children`

A `children` pass-thru that will be rendered inside of the Skia `Path` element, useful if you'd like to make e.g. a gradient path.

### Paint properties

The `Line` component will also pass the following [painting props](https://shopify.github.io/react-native-skia/docs/paint/overview) down to the underlying `Path` component:

- `color`
- `blendMode`
- `opacity`
- `antiAlias`
