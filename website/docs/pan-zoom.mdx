# Pan/Zoom

The `CartesianChart` and `PolarChart` components have opt-in support for "pan/zoom" gestures simply by using the `useChartTransformState` hook.

## useChartTransformState

At a high level, `useChartTransformState` initializes some structures internally that keep track of the pan/zoom operations and support subsequent gestures. These structures are Reanimated `SharedValue`s.

The signature of the function is:

```ts
useChartTransformState(): { state: ChartTransformState }

export type ChartTransformState = {
  panActive: SharedValue<boolean>;
  zoomActive: SharedValue<boolean>;
  origin: SharedValue<{ x: number; y: number }>;
  matrix: SharedValue<Matrix4>;
  offset: SharedValue<Matrix4>;
};
```

### panActive
`true` if the pan gesture is active

### zoomActive
`true` if the zoom/pinch gesture is active

### matrix
A `4 x 4` matrix used to keep track of all the pan / zoom transformation.

### origin
structure used internally to support tranformation gestures

### offset
stucture used internally to support transformation gestures
