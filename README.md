## Installation

Start by installing the peer dependencies of `victory-native` â€“ React Native Reanimated, Gesture Handler, and Skia:

```shell
yarn add react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler @shopify/react-native-skia
```

For Reanimated, you'll need to add `"react-native-reanimated/plugin"` to your `plugins` list in your `babel.config.js` config file.

Then install `victory-native`:

```shell
yarn add victory-native
```
